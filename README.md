### Follow the simple guide below for the model to function properly
install the required dependencies; pip install -r requirements.txt

Examine the folder structure:

Add the sad images of people into the sad directory

Add the happy images of people into the happy directory

Add the mix of sad and happy images of people into the classfication directory since the model will be using the images
from this folder to predict if a given image is sad or happy.

NB: The number of sad and happy images in the respective directories should be equal in number to ensure that the model is trained correctly
and with no or less bias.
